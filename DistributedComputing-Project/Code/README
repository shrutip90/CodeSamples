The source code for the project is under the following directories:
- /src/java: Contains Scribe application code
- /src/map-red: Contains the user-library code for running map-reduce kind of jobs on Scribe trees
- /src/app: Code for Face recognition function structured as a map-reduce job, to be dynamically invoked on the Scribe nodes. It also has the training set of images.

- 'lib' folder contains the FreePastry and JavaCV related libraries.

Executing the code:
---------------------------
'build.xml' contains the ant build script for compiling the scribe application as well as the
user-function specifed in /src/app. The parameters defined at the beginning of the file specify the
IP address and bind ports for the Pastry nodes and the number of Pastry Nodes to be created.
Change these parameters according to the addresses of the node on which to run.

To run the code, use 'ant'.

Note that the code presently runs only when all the nodes run on a single JVM. Small code modifications
are required to run it on multiple JVMs. Also, the query label to match with the images is hard-coded into the map function in src/app/FaceRecog.java, to avoid re-computing the label for the query image multiple times in map function. The training folder name and the application code file name 'FaceRecog' are also hard-coded. These have to be changed in code, if required. Sorry for the inconvenience.

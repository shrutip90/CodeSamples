List of code samples included:
==============================
## TermProject-HPPC: 
Term project for the course "High Performance Computing: Tools and Applications"
	- Team of two - included only my code here
	This project has two parts as mentioned in the report and poster. I had worked on implementing
    	Breadth First Search part while my teammate had worked on the other part - Algorithms for all 
    	pairs shortest paths problem. To avoid confusion, I have included only my code here.

## AOS-Projects: Course projects for the course "Advanced Operating Systems"
	a. Gtthreads: User-level thread library that mimicks pthreads, with a round-robin scheduler.
		- Individual project
	b. Barriers: Implementation of barriers for OpenMp and MPI threads in different ways:
		- Counter-based barrier, MCS barrier, Dissemination and Tournament barriers
		- Based on the paper "Algorithms for Scalable Synchronization on Shared-Memory Multiprocessors" 
		  (http://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.828/2010/readings/mcs.pdf) 
		- Team of two - I worked on Counter-based barrier and MCS barrier
	c. RPCProxy: Proxy server that works using RPC calls, using Apache thrift. 
		- Differnt caching mechanisms are implemented on the proxy side - Random, FIFO and LRU-MIN
		- Team of two - I worked in LRU-Min and FIFO caching implementation
	d. RVM: Implementation of Recoverable Virtual Memory to persist the changes to metadata and build fault-tolerance, using transactions
		- Team of two - Worked together on complete code

##  DistributedComputing-Project
	- Implementaion of a novel distributed processing system based on publish-subscribe mechanisms(usign Scribe), 
	that processes data in a similar fashion as MapReduce, but works on distributed input. Implemented a face recognition
	application for demonstration.
	- Team of two - We developed the idea together. I mainly worked on code and my teammate worked on the report.

## StatApp: Android app for collecting statistics from user devices
	- This app is developed for the measurements that we are performing as part of my MS Project.

## Web UI development: Developed https://www.imaids.com/ for a part-time job (Design was given).

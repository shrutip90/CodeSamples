To compile and run:
-------------------------------------------------
- (Optional) Run "thrift -r --gen cpp proxy.thrift" for generating RPC code. Delete the skeleton code file from the gen-cpp folder. This code is already present in the attached files.
- Run "make all" to build everything, including autogenerated code.
- Run "make server" and "make client" to build the respective parts separately.
- Use ./server <port-number> [<max-cache-size> <cache-policy-num>]
	- max-cache-size and cache-policy-num are required only if cache is tobe enabled
	- max-cache-size is the maximum size of cache in bytes
	- cache-policy-num should be given as:
		- 0 for RANDOM policy
		- 1 for FIFO policy
		- 2 for LRU_MIN policy
- Use ./client <ip-address> <port-num> <url-file> <workload-option> for running client code to fetch url. The url file should contain one url per line, with a max size of 80 chars. Workload option should be:
	- 0 for uniform distribution
	- 1 for exponential distribution
- Workload parameters like number of URLs to pick from the file, number of requestes to be issued and the workload distribution to be used, are defined using #define statements in src/Client.cpp. Please modify appropriately, if required.

File Descriptions:
-------------------------------------------------
- proxy.thrift: Thrift file with interface definition to the server methods. This is used for auto-generating the intermediate code for client-server interaction.
- urls.txt: URL file used for testing purposes.
- Folder "src": Code written for client, server and cache implementations
- Folder "obj": Objects correspoding to the code in "src" folder.
- Folder "gen-cpp": Auto-genearted code and corresponding objects.
- out.html: Output of the url request is written to this file.
